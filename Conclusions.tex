\subsection{Further Work}
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Atomic Concistency too much?}
    Requiring a system to implement Atomic Concistency is a very strong requirement and
    often comes at a steep runtime cost.\\
    Is it possible to implement a (faster) Sequential Consistency algorithm,
    implementing a 'fence' operation?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Exploding Serial Numbers}
    Number of messages sent is unbounded, memory complexity
    is logarithmic with number of messages sent (due to counters).
    \begin{block}{Reset Serial Numbers}
        Is it possible to add a mechanism to reset the serial numbers?
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Mallicious Serial Numbers}
        Is it possible for byzantine processes to cause the serial numbers (within correct processes) to explode?\\
        If so, is it possible to prevent this?
    \end{block}
\end{frame}
